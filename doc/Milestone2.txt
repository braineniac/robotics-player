Goals:
-test out the code on a real robot
-implement a detection algorithm for all field components: goals, pucks, poles

Tasks:
1, rewrite the base code in an object oriented way
2, implement a better obstacle detection function, return the distance of the
object and angle from the middle
3, write an averaging function that takes 5 laser data points and returns
their average. Also include handling of NaN and inf with some basic error
correction.
4, use openCV to recognise colors of the objects seen by the camera. Detect
their contours, approximate position and count.
5, combine the information from the camera and laser data to determine an
objects location in relation to the robot and which field component it is.
