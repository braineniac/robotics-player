With the help of Julian we replaced smach with pyTrees. We could finally debug the build map server and it returns
the detected map dimensions based on the distance relations between the three detected poles in front of it.
If it succeeds with this, it sets a guard boolean in the map build sequence(this is the first one thats run), so
it doesnt try to build the map again. It returns to the root, checks if there is an obstacle in front of it,
avoids it and does some random movement. If it fails to build a map due to not seeing enough poles or the data is off,
then it proceeds to turn left until it does.
We had some issues matching the laser data, first I thought its an error in the code, but it was due to the robot moving
way too much and the messages didnt have time to sync up correctly. I slowed down general movement and introduced a lot
of stops and waits to solve this problem.
We added team color detection by just checking for the very first goal we see that's closer than 2 meters and its color
is our team color.
Julian also adjusted the HSV values from the rosbag files so we hopefully dont have to tinker around too much with it
during the competition.
I also restructured the launch files so they call each other when beeing run so its more structured and easier to find
what exactly is beeing called.
