Milestone 1

Tasks to accomplish for this milestone

• The robot should drive around randomly (it’s up to you what “randomly” means)

• It must avoid obstacles, either by driving somewhere else, or around the obstacle

After setting up an environment in Ubuntu with ROS and the preset hockeyworld we determined the three main jobs for this milestone

1.) Reading the laser scan data and extracting necessary information into an processable array

2.) Avoiding obstacles and letting the robot turn if something is in front of him

3.) Controling the movement and letting it drive randomly around

1. The laser data can be found through the initializing of the sensor array and sliced into a front section which will be used to determine a obstacle in front of it.
The function laser_slice

2. The function obstacle_position holds the front array sliced into three seperate arrays. The seperate arrays will have a left, right and middle section with the data of range from the laser sensor. If one of the arrays holds a data smaller than a certain threshhold the robot should turn away so the obstacle can be avoided.
The function get_laser_datasize determines the size of the array

3. The function set_velocities is the control function for simple movement of the robot. It determines through linear x the direction and angular z the speed of the robot
